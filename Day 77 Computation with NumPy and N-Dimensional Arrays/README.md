# Computation_with_NumPy_and_N_Dimensional_Arrays

* Create arrays manually with `np.array()`

* Generate arrays using  `.arange()`, `.random()`, and `.linspace()`

* Analyse the shape and dimensions of a ndarray

* Slice and subset a ndarray based on its indices

* Do linear algebra like operations with scalars and matrix multiplication

* Use NumPys broadcasting to make ndarray shapes compatible

* Manipulate images in the form of ndarrays
